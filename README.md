# cd+
-------------------------------

**cd+** is a small tool that helps you traverse your directories
in a manner endowed with greater sanity.

Say your in /foo/bar/foobar/baz/foobaz/bazfoo and you want to go to foobar.
Traditionally, you would have to type :

```bash
cd ../../../
```

Now the same can be done with:

```bash
d foobar
```

Installation
------------

run:

```bash
./install.sh
```
